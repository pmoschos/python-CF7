# üìÇ File Operations Demo Script üìÑ

This Python script demonstrates file handling operations such as reading, creating, updating, and deleting files. It provides reusable functions to perform these operations and ensures proper error handling for robust execution.

---

## Script Overview üìò

The script defines the following file operation functions:

1. **`read_file`**: Reads and prints the content of a file along with its metadata.
2. **`read_file_contents`**: Reads and returns the content of a file as a string.
3. **`create_file`**: Creates a new file and writes initial content to it.
4. **`update_file`**: Appends new content to an existing file.
5. **`delete_file`**: Deletes a specified file.

It also includes a `main` function to demonstrate these operations sequentially.

## Key Features üåü

- **File Metadata**: Displays file details such as name, mode, and status.
- **Error Handling**: Handles missing files and IO errors gracefully.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

---

## Technical Requirements üîß

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended.
- **External Libraries**: None (uses only built-in Python functionalities).

---

## Installation and Setup üöÄ

No installation is required. Run the script directly from any Python-enabled environment:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `36_file_operations.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `36_file_operations.py`.
5. Run the script with:

   ```bash
   python 36_file_operations.py
   ```

## Usage Example üìã

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Creating 'example.txt':
File 'example.txt' created successfully with content.

Reading 'example.txt':
Filename: example.txt
Closed: False
Opening mode: r
Contents: This is the initial content of the file.
File closed after with-block: True

Updating 'example.txt':
File 'example.txt' updated successfully with new content.

Reading updated 'example.txt':
Filename: example.txt
Closed: False
Opening mode: r
Contents: This is the initial content of the file.
This is the appended content.
File closed after with-block: True

Deleting 'example.txt':
File 'example.txt' deleted successfully.

Reading 'example.txt' after deletion:
Error: File 'example.txt' does not exist or is not a valid file.
```
